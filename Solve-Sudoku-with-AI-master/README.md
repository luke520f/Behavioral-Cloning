# Solve Sudoku with AI

## Synopsis

In this project, it was implemented a Sudoku-solving agent developed to solve _diagonal_ Sudoku puzzles. A diagonal Sudoku puzzle is identical to traditional Sudoku puzzles with the added constraint that the boxes on the two main diagonals of the board must also contain the digits 1-9 in each cell (just like the rows, columns, and 3x3 blocks).

## Project setup
The first step is downloading [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)  

The next step is download [*aind environment*](https://github.com/BrunoEduardoCSantos/Solve-Sudoku-with-AI/blob/master/aind-universal.yml.txt).

### Activate the aind environment (OS X or Unix/Linux)
    
    `$ source activate aind`

### Activate the aind environment (Windows)

    `> activate aind`

### Run the code & visualization

    `(aind)$ python solution.py`

### Run the local test suite

    `(aind)$ python -m unittest -v`
